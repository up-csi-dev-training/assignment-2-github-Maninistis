"Ang paraan ng mga bagay-bagay" - beyabadohbi

[Refrain]
And there's so much left to say
I guess I'm just the bigger guy
And there's too much on my mind
That I don't even want to try
Guess it's not far from the ordinary
They do say "Love is blind"
But I guess that's the way things go

[Chorus]
If I told you, you'd know how to go and break my heart in two
'Cause I would anyways, we'd end up like always
You know me, you better show me that you could say it to my face
'Cause you know we're the same, there's worse things I can take

[Refrain]
There's so much left to say
I guess I'm just the bigger guy
And there's too much on my mind
That I don't even want to try
Guess it's not far from the ordinary
They do say "Love is blind"
But I guess that's the way things go

[Verse 1]
Didn't think you'd ever stoop so low
Getting with the only girl you know
A lousy route that only makes me say "That's pretty lame"
And that's the way things go
Oh, I guess that's just the way things go

[Verse 2]
Passed your house when I was on a train
In my mind, you'll always stay the same
I'm happy now, I ought to let you know
But I guess that's just the way things go
Oh, I guess that's just the way things go
And I don't mind that that's the way things go
And I don't mind, I don't mind

[Outro]
I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind, I don't mind
Oh, I guess that's just the way things go
Oh, I guess that's the way things go
